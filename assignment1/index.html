    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>This is an answere to all of the 13 questions that were given.</h2>
    <h3>
      1.What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      When I opened “broomstick” webpage, made by Christina Bertman, it
      immediately the website got my attention from the loading screen with
      vibrant lime green text and also the animated background of people just
      passing by without even noticing their surroundings. It gives me an
      expectation of what the user is going to experience right off the bat,
      which is how people are too focused on their own minds and forget about
      the surroundings and the small things. In addition, within the first few
      scrolls, I see the animation of the janitor traveling across the screen,
      like a video but being controlled by your scrolling motion. Overall, with
      the first look at the website, my attention was all on the animation,
      which makes the website feel alive and interesting more than just still
      images and text.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are multiple discrete actions on this website and that is what makes
      the experience so interesting. Here are a few examples from what I have
      been scrolling up and down:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The janitor moves across the screen and cleans the trash while I’m
        scrolling down
      </li>
      <li>
        Highlight the important words and small details to highlight the
        significance of janitors in our lives. Details could be from the circle
        motion to a word that marks a significant word or an icon to show an
        important mark or characters
      </li>
      <li>
        The series of paintings about janitors that users can scroll to view
        like how they are at a museum
      </li>
      <li>The tear-away animation of words that used to be “tag” to janitor</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Those are discrete actions that I found most interesting and obvious there
      are more. Those actions are used to emphasize the importance of the topic
      that the author wants to convey to users, in this case, the importance of
      janitors in our daily lives. Each animations and motion are related to the
      topic and message that the author wants to spread to the public.
    </p>

    <h3>
      3.What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The website is so interesting with multiple actions and motions that keep
      the users engaged. Usually, a website is normally static with a few
      animations here and there to transition between pages,“broomstick” makes
      animation its best attribute. Not only that it used to transition from
      topic to topic but it also helps highlight the importance of the message
      that the author is trying to spread.
    </p>

    <h3>
      4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most common action is mailing scrolling down. The website is built
      like a gallery of images and information, the more the user scrolls down
      the more they will learn about the experience. Often I scroll back up and
      down just to see if the animation works both ways or if it only works when
      you scroll in down. Both ways work perfectly and I continue to explore the
      website
    </p>
    <h3>
      5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The author understands the usage of interactive actions and incorporates
      it so well with the message. Hence it creates a joyful impression for me
      when I scroll through the site. Each scroll has a purpose to highlight the
      important job of a janitor and I do not feel like there is a scroll that
      just scrolls down. Each time I interact is another interactive experience
      through the site like I am walking down a museum.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The interactive experience helps to convey the message innovatively. By
      having an interactive experience, the user, like me, does not feel
      overwhelmed by looking at a still website with words and colors. The
      interactive helps visual learners to understand to primary goal in more
      detail as well. By that, the interactive experience of the site not only
      helps to better the experience but also helps the user to better
      understand the meaning of the site.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The impressions between the first, second, and third are obviously
      different. The first time I opened the website it was full of surprises
      and “aw” due to the level of interaction that a user can experience like
      sending a heart by clicking at the heart to send thank you to all the
      janitors. However, after the 2nd and 3rd interactions, I felt like there
      was nothing other that could catch my attention anymore, during the first
      impression I had experienced it all, and now it is just a scroll motion
      down with repeated animation. I think the reason for that is not a bad
      thing but due to the nature of surprise. Like a museum, you feel amazed at
      first but since you have experienced it before, the 2nd time becomes
      boring.
    </p>
    <h3>
      8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think the more we interact with the experience the more boring it will
      be. It's a repeated cycle of scrolling down through all the animation. By
      the third time, I felt that I understood what each of my scrolls was going
      to activate what action at what part of the website. The frequency of me
      logging on to the site is too frequent, making the site seem to be less
      interactive than the first. However, if I were to leave the site for a
      month or two and log back in, I would find the experience joyful again due
      to how long I have not visited the site.
    </p>
    <h3>
      9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The author references paintings in the experience. The paintings were from
      multiple timeframes but mainly to show that the janitor were being painted
      forever and had their own impacts on art.
    </p>
    <h3>
      10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Those paintings help me understand more about janitors in paint. Most of
      the paintings are about scenery or beautiful people. Painting is just like
      real life, it forgets the janitor and how they keep our city, and scenery
      beautiful so that there are beautiful paintings of amazing cities.
    </p>
    <h3>
      11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I feel those paintings even tho it does not appear in the museum all the
      time or people take pictures of them all the time is there to remind us of
      the silent work that janitors do all the time through many years ago just
      to keep the scene clean and tidy
    </p>
    <h3>
      12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h3>
    <p>
      To me, the most frustrating part of the interaction must be the scroll up
      sometimes does not have the smoothest experience. It could be that the
      intention of the author only wants the site to go one way down and not the
      other but having to scroll back up sometime I feel slow down the
      experience
    </p>
    <h3>
      13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I like the animation of the interactive because it helps me to further
      understand the message by highlighting the important words and details. In
      addition, interactions like clicking on the heart create a bond with the
      website, erase the black screen of the computer and let the user have a
      sense of contribution by sending hearts as a thank you to all the
      janitors.
