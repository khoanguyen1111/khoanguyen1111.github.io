          >1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting

    <p>
      When I opened “broomstick” webpage, made by Christina Bertman, it
      immediately the website got my attention from the loading screen with
      vibrant lime green text and also the animated background of people just
      passing by without even noticing their surroundings. It gives me an
      expectation of what the user is going to experience right off the bat,
      which is how people are too focused on their own minds and forget about
      the surroundings and the small things. In addition, within the first few
      scrolls, I see the animation of the janitor traveling across the screen,
      like a video but being controlled by your scrolling motion. Overall, with
      the first look at the website, my attention was all on the animation,
      which makes the website feel alive and interesting more than just still
      images and text.

          >2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.</b
        ></span

    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple discrete actions on this website and that is what makes
      the experience so interesting. Here are a few examples from what I have
      been scrolling up and down: Those are discrete actions that I found most interesting and obvious there are more. Those actions are used to emphasize the importance of the topic that the author wants to convey to users, in this case, the importance of janitors in our daily lives. Each animations and motion are related to the topic and
      <ol>
        <li>The janitor moves across the screen and cleans the trash while I’m scrolling down</li>
        <li>Highlight the important words and small details to highlight the significance of janitors in our lives. Details could be from the circle motion to a word that marks a significant word or an icon to show an important mark or characters </li>
        <li>The series of paintings about janitors that users can scroll to view like how they are at a museum</li>
        <li>The tear-away animation of words that used to be “tag” to janitor</li>

     </ol>

          >3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
          </b
        ></span
      >
    </p>
    <p>The website is so interesting with multiple actions and motions that keep the users engaged. Usually, a website is normally static with a few animations here and there to transition between pages,“broomstick” makes animation its best attribute. Not only that it used to transition from topic to topic but it also helps highlight the importance of the message that the author is trying to spread. </p>
    <p>
      <span
        ><b
          >4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?
          </b
        ></span
      >
    </p>
    <p>The most common action is mailing scrolling down. The website is built like a gallery of images and information, the more the user scrolls down the more they will learn about the experience. Often I scroll back up and down just to see if the animation works both ways or if it only works when you scroll in down. Both ways work perfectly and I continue to explore the website</p>
