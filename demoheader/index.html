        1.What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <br> 
      <p>
        When I opened “broomstick” webpage, made by Christina Bertman, it
        immediately the website got my attention from the loading screen with
        vibrant lime green text and also the animated background of people just
        passing by without even noticing their surroundings. It gives me an
        expectation of what the user is going to experience right off the bat,
        which is how people are too focused on their own minds and forget about
        the surroundings and the small things. In addition, within the first few
        scrolls, I see the animation of the janitor traveling across the screen,
        like a video but being controlled by your scrolling motion. Overall, with
        the first look at the website, my attention was all on the animation,
        which makes the website feel alive and interesting more than just still
        images and text.

        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        There are multiple discrete actions on this website and that is what makes
        the experience so interesting. Here are a few examples from what I have
        been scrolling up and down:1.The janitor moves across the screen and
        cleans the trash while I’m scrolling down Highlight the important words
        and small details to highlight the significance of janitors in our lives.
        Details could be from the circle motion to a word that marks a significant
        word or an icon to show an important mark or characters The series of
        paintings about janitors that users can scroll to view like how they are
        at a museum.2. The tear-away animation of words that used to be “tag” to
        janitor Those are discrete actions that I found most interesting and
        obvious there are more.3. Those actions are used to emphasize the
        importance of the topic that the author wants to convey to users, in this
        case, the importance of janitors in our daily lives. Each animations and
        motion are related to the topic and message that the author wants to
        spread to the public.
